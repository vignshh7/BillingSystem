Point of Sale (POS) System
A web-based POS system for managing orders, billing, sales reports, and inventory. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (jQuery), it uses localStorage for data persistence and supports a responsive interface for restaurant or retail use.
Features

Menu Management: Displays menu items from data.json with images and prices.
Order Management: Add, cancel, or clear items in an order.
Billing: Generates bills with 18% GST, tender, and change calculations.
Sales Report: Filters sales by time period (e.g., today, custom range).
Inventory Tracking: Monitors purchased, sold, and in-stock quantities.
Responsive Design: Adapts to desktop, tablet, and mobile screens.


Usage

Notes

Data: Stored in localStorage, persists across sessions.
